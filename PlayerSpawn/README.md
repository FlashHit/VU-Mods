# PlayerSpawn

Write "!spawnme" + spawnpoint (optional) to spawn yourself<br>
for example: "!spawnme b" or "!spawnme ru"<br>
just "!spawnme" works too.<br>
after the first spawn you can use "!respawnme"<br>
To spawn at a flag it needs to be captured, otherwise you won't spawn.<br>
VehicleSpawning isn't working yet.
